## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

    * A method executes or changes code based on the method used and the parameters given. You can use them to write a bunch of code as many times as you want, or call upon a method to do difficult math. You can use methods to remove, add to, or show parts of strings/arrays. As I learned with Day 4, you can use a method to define the actions of another method and how it relates to outside variables, or even just create a method by defining it. It seems that the purpose of a method is to make Ruby do nearly anything you want.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

` def hello(a)
    puts "#{a}"
  end

  hello("Sam I am")`

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

` def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
  end

  hello_someone(gets.chomp)`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

    * All you have to do to call it is use the name of the new method. Then you can also assign a value to its argument.

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

    * No questions so far! I may have some once I really start putting my nose to the book to study, but that's later. I always know who to ask and that I can whenever I need!
