## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  It allows us to use a commonly used block of code throughout our code without having to type it out every time.
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone(Sam)

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
How complex do they get in real world coding? Or is it good practice to keep them as simple as possible?
