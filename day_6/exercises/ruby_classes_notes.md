# Notes from "The Object Model" on LaunchSchool

   * Most things are Ruby objects, but methods and blocks are not
   * Classes are molds, objects are based on classes
   * <object>.class can be used to determine a datatype
   * Classes are in CamelCase, meaning that there are no spaces/underscores/hyphens and every new word is capitalized
   * `x = <class>.new` can create a new instance of a class -- this is called "instantiation
   * Can be made with:
`class Hamburger
end

boatburger = Hamburger.new`

# Notes from "Classes and Objects - Part 1" on LaunchSchool

   * Attributes are determined at the instance level
   * Frankly a lot of code that's referenced in student.rb anyway
