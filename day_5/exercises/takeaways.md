#Takeaways from Ruby in 100 minutes
   * `produce = {"apples" => 3, "oranges" => 1, "carrots" => 12}` works and is a nice way to abbreviate things
   * => that thing is called a "rocket"
   * "apples" or anything like it is called a "key"
   * can do `<hash>["newkey"] = <number>` to assign both a new key and a value for it
   * the same can be done with a key that already exists, this will update its value
   * do `<hash>.keys` or `<hash>.values` to only get those things
   * another way to write a hash: `produce = {apples: 3, oranges: 1, carrots: 12}`
   * then call it with `produce[:oranges]`
