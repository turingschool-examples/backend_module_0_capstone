## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

SMART goals and ZPD.  Both of these examples are both new and also familiar to me.  Conceptually familiar, but
named new. Using SMART goals outlines the approach for progression.  You can't expect to build the Eiffel Tower
without first knowing that righty is tighty and lefty is loosey.  Progressing within the ZPD requires use of
goals that can be objectively considered specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.  ZPD refers to a problem JUST out of the current knowledgebase which requires either little or no assistance to progress to.
Using these in tandem will grow the knowledgebase in a structured manner.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I understand that mistakes are essential to learning and that focusing on the process.  If you can't get over
making mistakes, you won't be able to grow your knowledge base.  You have to understand both what works and why,
but also what doesn't work and why.  Focusing on the process to get there will expand the mindset and allow
one to see the bigger picture.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is more of a database to store and organize data, whereas an array is organized IN ORDER.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`pet_store = {birds: 107, cats: 15, dogs: 10, reptiles: 29}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`puts #{states.values[1]}`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

`states.keys` or `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
For a particular object that has a variety of variables (e.g. a car), where data is not all necessarily needing
to be organized in order but there is a lot of data.
car = {
        'make' => 'Honda',
        'model' => 'CRV',
        'MPG' => 25,
        'color' => blue  
}

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
If there are specific situations to use the different syntaxes
