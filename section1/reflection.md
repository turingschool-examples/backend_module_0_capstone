## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

    Definitely resonated with me for positive habit formation and implementation of positive growth mindset principles.  I need to take more breaks and read more, but understanding that the learning process will result in a more refined final result is something that has been drilled into me professionally.  I actively try to look at each situation, positive or negative, as an opportunity to learn or grow, although there are certainly times where frustration gets the best of me.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

    `puts "Hello World!"`

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

    The pound(#) symbol.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

    An integer is a whole number, floating point allows for decimal points.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

    `animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

    `puts animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

    Interpolation is the act of inserting variables into code via reference keys.
    e.g. `puts "The best #{animal} is the fruit stripe one."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
    `gets`
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
    Extracting a substring from a string involves the variable being called and then using a starting index number, followed by the number of characters enclosed within brackets after the variable.
    e.g.
    `password = "password123"`
    `password[0,7]`
    This would generate a substring starting with the first character and 7 total.

    String interpolation allows for combining strings and also you can use code within the string.
    e.g.
    name = "Brian"
    dog_name = "Toby"
    `puts "Hello #{name}, this is #{dog_name}.  I can finally speak.  I know 2+2 is #{2+2}."`
