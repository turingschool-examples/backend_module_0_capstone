# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
can_he_return = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
puts can_he_return


# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
puts "We had #{students} students, now we have #{students + 2}."
puts "#{students} to start, #{students + 2} now."
#I notice print vs puts - print shows the quotation marks

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
students = 22
puts "We had #{students} students, now we have #{students - 2}."
puts "#{students} to start, #{students - 2} now."



# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Brian"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 1

puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# First name is a string because it is a variable represented by text.  Is_hungry as a variable
# is a boolean operation due to the answer, and number of pets has to be an integer because
# float doesn't make sense.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Toby"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 0

puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "Total number of snacks:"
puts healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
  #yes
