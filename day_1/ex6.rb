# ruby assigns intergar value of 10 to variable named types_of_people
types_of_people = 10
# ruby formats the value, intergar, of variable types_of_people into a string with
# text. Then assigns the string to the variable named x.
x = "There are #{types_of_people} types of people."
# ruby assigns string to variable named binary.

# ruby assigns string to variable named do_not

# ruby formats values of variables binary and do_not, both strings, into a string.
# Assigns the formatted string to variable y.
# 2. String inside of a string.
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."

# ruby prints value of x

# ruby prints value of y

# ruby formats variable x into a string then prints the string.

# ruby formats variable y into a string then prints the string.

# ruby assigns flase boolean value to variable named hilarious.

# ruby assigns a string to variable named w.
w = 'This is the left side of...'
# ruby assigns a string to variable named e.
e = "a string with a right side."

# ruby concatenates string values of varaibles w and e then prints the
# concatenated string.
puts w + e

# 4.  adding two strings together concatenates them, ruby links them together
#     making them one new string. Thus the string is longer as they combine
#     length.
# 5.  Changed string to be within single quotation marks on line 38. Works the
#     same as double quotes. I am guessing ruby recognises "" and '' interchangably
#     so it doesn't matter which you use.
