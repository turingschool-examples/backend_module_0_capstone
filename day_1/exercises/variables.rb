# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:

name = "Kris Litman"
puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:

var = 'Dobby'
puts var

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
harry = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
puts harry

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
puts "There were #{students} students, but now we have #{students + 2} students."


# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
