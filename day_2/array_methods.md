# Arrays and Their methods

- The shovel operator `<<` adds an element to the end of an array. I don't think  that is technically a method, but it is helpful.

- `.sort` method will return a new array with the elements sorted either alphabetically (if strings) or numerically (if integers/floats).

- `.last` method will return the final element in an array. Correspondingly the `.first` will return the first element.

- `.each` method when given a block will call the block for each element in the arrays.

- `.collect` method will iterate each element returning the results of the block for each element in a new array.

- `.shuffle` method will return a new array with the elements reordered.

`.slice` method will return the specified element(s) from the array. can also be written with [`index`]
