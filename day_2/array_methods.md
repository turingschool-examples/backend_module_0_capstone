# Array Methods
## In my own words:
* *.sort* returns a sorted array. If no block is included, strings are sorted alphabetically and integers/ floats are sorted in ascending order.
* *.each* calls block of code for each element of array and returns a new array.
* *.join* returns a string by taking each element of an array and converting to string using specified separator (optional- default is empty string).
* *.index* returns the index of given element. If block is provided, it returns the index of the first element in an array that returns true for the given block.
* *.inlcude?* returns a boolean value-- true if the element is present in the array and false if it isn't.
* *.collect* runs the block of code once for each element of an array and returns a new array with results.
* *.first / .last*  returns first and last element of an array respectively.
* *.shuffle* returns a new array with the elements of the original array shuffled. (original array immutable)
