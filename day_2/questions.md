## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`

```
["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

```
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

```
animals[1]
```

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

```
animals << "lion"
```

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:

.pop - This method removes the last element from an array and returns it

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

You would use the == comparison operator. The result returned if you evaluated 2 == 25 would be false

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

You would use the greater than symbol >, and 25 > 2 would evaluate to true
