1. Get the dimension value from the user and assign to `dimensions` variable.
2. Odd rows: Create a function that can print odd rows. It should run while a counter is greater than 0 and print x's if the counter is odd and spaces if it's even.
3. Even rows: Create a similar function that prints even rows. It should run while a counter is greater than 0 but print x's if the counter is even and spaces if it's odd.
4. Alternate row function calls: Create a function that tracks the number of rows being created and calls either the odd or even rows function depending on if a counter is even or odd.
5. Finally, call the tracker function from step 4, passing in the user's `dimensions` input as  a parameter.
