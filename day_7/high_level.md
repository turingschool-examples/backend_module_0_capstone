## Solving Problems

### Caesar Cipher

For this problem I am going to look up the shift method on ruby docs, and also google the caesar cipher to see if there are any good examples in ruby. I am not sure exactly what method I will need to solve this, but I am going to do some research and see if there is a way to link the two different variables that are set to the normal alphabet & ciphered alphabet. Once they are linked I will try to find a method that will pull from the ciphered alphabet and replace the characters in the normal one (maybe gsub method?).

### Checker Board

To solve this problem I want to first identify what strategy or technique I think I should use to print out "X X X" a certain amount of times. I am thinking to use an if/elsif/else statement to print out even & odd amounts of the checkers. I also need to get user input to see the amount of lines the user wants to create. I am going to practice by using Repl.it and try using the .times method and gets.chomp to get the input, and play around with different techniques & methods to get the appropriate output.
