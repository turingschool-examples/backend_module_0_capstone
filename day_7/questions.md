## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  
A method is a verb, it does something to something to an object.


1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello(a)
 puts "#{a} I am"
end

hello("Sam")
```

2. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end
```

3. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```ruby
hello_someone("Hanna")
```

4. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?  
I will definitely be using the next two weeks to practice more!
